# CTF Writeups - Luke Wilbur

## Purpose
This repository collects my personal writeups, taken from cybersecurity CTF competitions I joined individually or with Dartmouth's Cybersecurity Society.  They are intended to teach others who could not complete the challenges, while also solidifying my personal understanding of cybersecurity concepts.  As such - to ensure my code and writeups are clear - I have extensively explained and commented my work.

## Thanks
I give my deepest thanks to my fellow leaders and members in Dartmouth's Cybersecurity Society, who have shared their knowledge and unending enthusiasm with me.  Here's to many more CTFs together!
